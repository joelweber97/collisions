					Wildlife-Vehicle Collisions
				</h2>
				<p>
					Many factors play a rold in wildlife-vehicle collisions. Factors include an expanding infrastructure 
					network into remote areas, higher volume of vehicles on roadways, and increased speed of motorists.
					Another factor is the likelihood of wildlife to travel into residential areas to look for food.

					Not a pretty sight, and not usually a topic for discussion. 
					But in British Columbia perhaps it should be talked about more often.<br />
					<br />
					When you are driving in British Columbia, one of the main attractions is the 
					opportunity to view its varied and abundant wildlife. However, because human 
					travel corridors and animal travel routes frequently occur along the same 
					valley bottoms, this concentration of human activity and wildlife leads to 
					a high potential for a wildlife vehicle collision, which can happen anywhere, 
					and at anytime. <br />
					<br />
					Sadly, each year in BC, over 23,650 animals are killed by collisions with vehicles. 
					As well as the loss of wildlife, every year, 4 people are killed and 380 people are 
					injured in this type of collision. <br />
					<br />
					The intention of the Wildlife Collision Prevention Program (WCPP) is to make BC's 
					highways safer for both people and wildlife. There is a lot motorists can do to improve 
					their chances of avoiding a wildlife vehicle collision. <br />
